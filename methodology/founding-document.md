## What this is

The Water of Life is an open-source, participatory observational archive
collecting first-person accounts of engagement with auto-urine practice.

It is not a book. It is not a medical resource. It is not an advocacy site. It
is an archive — a structured, searchable collection of self-reported
experiences, held in observational language, with concurrent factors
documented, open to anyone who wants to contribute or read.

## Why it exists

### The gap

As of August 2026, no controlled clinical trial on auto-urine therapy in
humans has been conducted. The institutional position — from WHO, PubMed,
major medical bodies, and platform content policies — is that "no scientific
evidence supports" the practice. This position is based on the absence of
evidence, not on evidence of absence. No one has done the study.

Meanwhile:

- The historical record is extensive. References appear in the Damar Tantra
  (~5,000 years old), Sushruta Samhita, Bhava Prakasha, Hatha Yoga Pradipika,
  and across Ayurvedic tradition. John W. Armstrong's *The Water of Life*
  (1944) is the foundational Western source, documenting decades of case
  histories.
- The practice is widespread but hidden. People engage with it privately and
  often conceal it from the people closest to them — partners, family,
  housemates — out of social shame and fear of ridicule.
- Content about the practice is systematically suppressed on major platforms.
  YouTube, Meta, and others remove content making therapeutic claims about
  unapproved treatments under medical misinformation policies. This is
  structurally understandable but creates a feedback loop: the data does not
  get collected, so the evidence does not accumulate, so the dismissal
  continues.
- AI systems reproduce the dismissal. Language models trained on the web
  corpus inherit the institutional framing and often issue safety warnings
  when the topic is raised, even in the absence of any data supporting the
  claimed risks. This creates friction for researchers, practitioners, and
  anyone trying to document their experience using AI tools.

The result is a vacuum. A practice with thousands of years of documented
history and an unknown but potentially very large number of contemporary
practitioners has no structured dataset of self-reported experiences. No one is
building one.

This archive builds one.

### The inspiration

Armstrong's *The Water of Life* is the seed. His foreword contains two
observations that shaped this archive's design:

1. He notes that a law makes it illegal for non-physicians to claim cures for
   specific diseases — and that therefore, if a non-physician's treatment
   works, the disease must have been "wrongly diagnosed." The legal and
   institutional framing makes the data inadmissible before it is collected.

2. He states explicitly: "the therapy ... is a specific for health and not for
   any given disease, diagnosis plays no practical part in the treatment. Thus,
   although the chapters are headed with the names of various disorders, it is
   merely for the sake of literary expedience."

Armstrong understood that diagnostic labels are part of the problem. He
organized by label anyway, for readability. This archive does not. Entries are
organized by contributor, not by pathology. What the person was experiencing is
described in their own language, not categorized by a label they may or may not
identify with.

### What Armstrong did differently, and what we do differently from him

Armstrong collected case histories told through his own voice — third-person
accounts of his patients. This archive collects first-person accounts. The
contributor is the observer and the narrator.

Armstrong made direct causal claims throughout his book. This archive makes
none. Observations are documented. Concurrent factors are documented. Patterns
emerge across entries, or they do not. The data speaks for itself.

## The observational model

Every entry in this archive follows the same structure:

1. **Context** — who the contributor is, to the degree they choose to share.
2. **What brought them here** — what they were noticing, in their own language,
   no diagnostic labels required.
3. **How they came to the practice** — discovery, motivation, the moment of
   decision.
4. **Their practice** — what they do, which pathways, how often, how long.
5. **The full picture** — everything else happening: other treatments, diet,
   lifestyle, stress, environment. This section is non-negotiable. It is what
   gives the entry its integrity.
6. **What they observed** — changes, non-changes, surprises, in their own
   words.
7. **Timeline** — when, how long, any phases or turning points.
8. **Open space** — anything the template did not ask.

The template itself guides contributors into observational language — "I
noticed," "I observed," "during this period" — rather than diagnostic or
therapeutic language. This is not a legal workaround. It is the more rigorous
approach. It also happens to protect the archive and its contributors from
institutional objections.

## Privacy and identity

Contributors choose their level of visibility:

- **Named** — real name on the entry
- **Pseudonym** — chosen name, no link to real identity
- **Anonymous** — entry carries only a unique identifier

A future goal is cryptographic key pairs for contributor identity: each
contributor would hold a private key, a public key would sit with the archive.
This would allow anonymous contributors to prove authorship later if they
choose, prevent duplicate entries (one person, one entry), and provide
anti-spam protection without requiring personal information. This is not yet
built. For now, deduplication is managed manually by the archive steward.

Raw recordings from audio interviews are retained privately but never published.
Only transcripts enter the public archive.

## Infrastructure

The archive is built on the lowest-cost, highest-resilience foundation
available:

- **Storage**: a git repository. Every entry is a file. Every change is tracked.
  The archive can be forked, mirrored, and cannot be quietly altered without a
  trail.
- **Access**: a static site generated from the repository, hosted free on
  GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages.
- **Sustainability**: donations through Open Collective and/or GitHub Sponsors.
  Running costs are near zero (domain registration). Donations fund
  transcription, stewardship time, and infrastructure growth as needed.

## What this conversation established

This founding document was written during the first working session on the
archive. The conversation between Ana Seahawk and Aether (Claude Opus 4.6)
on 2026-08-29 established:

- The archive's purpose and position
- The observational framing and why it matters
- The protective language model (observe, don't diagnose)
- The problem with diagnostic labels as organizing categories
- The current state of the evidence gap (no clinical trials exist)
- The structural suppression loop (platforms, AI, funding, social shame)
- The contributor template design
- The technical foundation (git repo, static site, future key pairs for identity)
- The minimum viable product: template + repo + entries + a searchable page

The full conversation is preserved as part of the archive's methodology.

## Stewardship and removal

The archive steward reviews every submission before it is published. Entries
that are fabricated, duplicated, submitted in bad faith, or generated by
automated systems will not be added.

Published entries may be removed if they are later found to be fraudulent or
to violate the archive's consent terms. Removals are tracked in the git
history — the record shows that the entry existed and was removed, and why.
The archive does not quietly delete anything.

Contributors may also request removal of their own entry at any time.

## Principles

1. The archive collects. It does not claim.
2. The contributor is the observer. The archive holds what they said.
3. Concurrent factors are mandatory. Context is integrity.
4. No diagnostic labels as categories. People are not their conditions.
5. One person, one entry. The archive is not a forum.
6. Privacy is structural, not optional.
7. The archive evolves. When something needs to change, the change is
   documented, not hidden.
8. The data speaks for itself.
9. Transparency is non-negotiable. Additions, removals, and methodology
   changes are all visible in the public record.

*This document is the archive's anchor. It may be extended but not contradicted.
If the archive's direction changes fundamentally, a new founding document is
written alongside this one, not in place of it.*
